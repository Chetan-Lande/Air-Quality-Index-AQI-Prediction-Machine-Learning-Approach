# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Approach
This repository presents an AQI prediction project using machine learning, developed during an internship. It employs environmental data and modern algorithms to create a reliable model for air pollution management. Components include a dataset, random forest regression model, Jupyter notebook, Python scripts, and improvement recommendations.

# Overview  
This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on key pollutants and environmental parameters using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide actionable insights into air quality, supporting data-driven decision-making for environmental management.  

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of a predictive model using **Random Forest Regression**. Results are visualized to understand patterns and evaluate model performance.

# 2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Analyze the distribution of pollutants and AQI values.  
- Identify **trends**, **patterns**, and **correlations** within the dataset.  

# 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Enhance model performance by creating or transforming features.  
- Consider factors like time-series patterns, seasonal variations, and pollutant interactions.  

# 4. **Apply Machine Learning Algorithms**
- Experiment with various ML algorithms, including:
  - Linear Regression  
  - KNN
